## Bonus:
* Consider that the locations of depots and clients are nodes of a connected subgraph of a grid graph. The vehicles can only travel along the edges of this graph. The time required to move between adjacent nodes is given by a cost matrix.
* Modify the algorithm that allocates clients to vehicles, such that the vehicles will travel on the shortest paths when moving from the depot to the clients, from one client to another or back to the depot.
* Can you improve the complexity of the algorithm if all the values in the cost matrix are the same?
* Create a random problem generator and test your algorithm for large instances. (Drawing a textual representation of the map, using Unicode symbols would be nice).
