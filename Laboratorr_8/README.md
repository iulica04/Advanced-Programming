## Compulsory
* Create a relational database using any RDBMS (Oracle, Postgres, MySql, Java DB, etc.).
* Write an SQL script that will create the required tables in order to store the books.
* Update pom.xml, in order to add the database driver to the project libraries.
* Create a singleton class in order to manage a connection to the database.
* Create a DAO class for managing the authors.

## Homework 
* Create an object-oriented model of the data managed by the Java application.
* Implement all the DAO classes.
* Use a connection pool in order to manage database connections, such as C3PO, HikariCP or Apache Commons DBCP.
* Create a tool to import data from a real dataset, such as Goodreads-books or other.
